  "Autoregression uses previous values of a time-series to predict the" +
  "value of the next time point. It is based on the assumption that the" +
  "past values of a time-series are related to the future values in a" +
  "linear way. The optimal value for an autoregressive model is" +
  "determined by the complexity of the relationship between the past" +
  "and future values in the time-series data. A larger value may" +
  "capture more of this complexity, but it may also increase the risk" +
  "of overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely" +
  "and may not generalize well to new data. On the other hand, a" +
  "smaller value may not capture enough complexity and may result in a" +
  "model with lower accuracy.";
