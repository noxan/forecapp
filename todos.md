# TODOs

Stick to essential model configurations.


- [ ] Better describe, name and organize model configuration (high)
- [ ] Data explorer (high)
- [ ] Simplify energy dataset (high)
- [ ] Exports for CSV (high)
- [ ] Recruit new people for user interviews (high)

- [ ] Validation for model configuration (medium)
- [ ] History of model scores (low priority)
- [ ] Configuration wizard (skip for now)

## Bugfixes

- [ ] Add cancel button during loading state
- [x] Get api working again and not time out after 30s
- [ ] Add time information to x-axis
- [ ] Remove unused code (after data explorer refactor)

## For beginners

- Test if people understand forecasting vocabulary, e.g. "regularization", "autoregression" - not a problem if experts get it, discussion: where is the line between expert and beginner? and how do such tools differ for experts and beginners? -> show help


## Further ideas

- Explainable charts directly via python plot: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72930513/how-to-plot-plotly-chart-on-react-from-json-response-from-flask-api
